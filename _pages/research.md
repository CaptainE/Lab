# Research

Our group’s research focuses on Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Human-in-the-Loop Computing with applications ranging from image based geolocalization to assistive technology for the visually impaired. Much of our work involves humans and machines working together to solve challenging problems involving fine grained categorization and perceptual organization. Follow the links below to learn about our project themes and see our publications in these areas.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Embeddings and  Metric Learning.** ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/MetricLearning.png){: style="width: 250px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px"}Understanding similarities between images is a key problem in computer vision. To measure the similarity between images, they are typically embedded in a featurevector space, in which their distance preserve the relative dissimilarity. These vector space representations are commonly used in applications such as image retrieval, classification or visualizations.

In our group, we are interested in many aspects of similarity learning. On one hand, we work on fundamental methods to learn similarity spaces. One the other hand, we work on applications of visual similarities in areas such as fine-grained categorization and recommendation systems. 


**Privacy and security.**

Massive data collection required for training deep neural networks presents serious privacy issues. Centralized collection of photos, speech, and video from millions of individuals is ripe with privacy risks. 

Ideally, the learning algorithms would protect the privacy of users’ training data, by guaranteeing that the output model generalizes away from the specifics of any individual user. 
However, established machine learning algorithms make no such guarantee, and private, sensitive training data can be recovered from models. A model may implicitly store some of its training data, and careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information. 

We aim to better understand vulnerabilities of machine learning models and to provide proper defense methods against adversarial attacks.

**Visual Style**.

Style and content are two separate factors of an image. While most previous computer vision research has been focused on visual content (e.g., recognizing object categories), there is an increasing interest in understanding and manipulating visual style. At SE(3), we are mainly interested in two different but related domains: 1) Artistic style, and 2) Clothing style.<br/><br/><br/>


**COCO.** Common Objects in Context (COCO) is a database that aims to enable future research for object detection, instance segmentation, image captioning, and person keypoints localization.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren. 

**Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.**

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
